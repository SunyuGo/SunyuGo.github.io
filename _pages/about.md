Welcome to my site！I'm a first-year robotics PhD candidate at the University of New South Wales'School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering, co-advised by [Dr.Leo Wu](https://www.drliaowu.com) and [Prof. Jay Katupitiya](https://www.unsw.edu.au/staff/jay-katupitiya). My research interest lies in the areas of Medical Robotics, such as Flexible Robots for Autonomous Minimally Invasive Surgery and Assistive Robots with Artificial Muscles and Wearable Sensors. I’m funded through the University International Postgraduate Award.

Prior to joining UNSW, I earned my Bachelor's degree from the School of Vehicle Engineering at Chongqing University of Technology and Master's degree from the College of Mechanical and Vehicle Engineering at Chongqing University where I started my research on Multibody Dynamics and Machine Learning with [Prof. Yongjun Pan](https://faculty.cqu.edu.cn/YongjunPan/zh_CN/index/338379/list/index.htm).
